The files contained here are notebooks of each different stage we followed for our methodology.

1. Extract Google Play Store reviews with the google-play-scraper package, scraping from Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime and HBOMax review pages.
2. Text Cleaning with re library, filtering dataset to only English language with langdetect.
3. Use TextBlob and VADER (Sentiment Analysis)
4. Using HuggingFace to fine-tune RoBERTa model to our data (Sentiment Analysis)
5. Using TensorFlow to train/develop BiLSTM (Sentiment Analysis
6. Using BERTopic to conduct Topic Modeling
7. Combine all results into a singular file
8. Use Tableau to analyse and develop Visualisations to generate insights

This methodology can be further improved by using RPA or other methods to create a seamless pipeline, from data extraction into data visualisation.
